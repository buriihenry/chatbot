# 🤖 Chatbot Project

Welcome to the **Chatbot Project**!

This is a simple chatbot designed to chat, answer questions, and even crack a joke or two. Whether you're here to learn, have fun, or build something cool, you're in the right place!

## 🌟 Why I Built This

I created this project to explore how we can use AI to make tech more helpful and fun. The goal is to build a chatbot that’s:

* Friendly and easy to use
* Helpful with basic questions
* A fun way to learn about Python and AI

I hope you enjoy interacting with it — and if you have ideas to improve it, I’d love to hear from you!
